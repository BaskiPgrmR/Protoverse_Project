# Industrial Prototyping Platform (VR/AR + Digital Twins)

An immersive, collaborative VR/AR platform that enables industrial teams to prototype, test, and collaborate on 3D models virtually. This solution reduces the need for expensive physical prototypes, accelerates design iterations, and improves safety during industrial training and validation.

## Problem Statement
Industrial prototyping is expensive, requiring physical materials and specialized facilities. Collaboration across distributed teams is inefficient, slowing design iteration. Certain industries such as chemical and heavy machinery face safety risks in training and testing. Inefficient prototyping impacts innovation, competitiveness, and productivity.

## Our Solution
A VR/AR-enabled digital prototyping platform that allows teams to:
- Import CAD/3D models and convert them into optimized interactive digital twins.
- Interact with models in VR/AR: grab, scale, assemble, measure, and test workflows.
- Collaborate in real time with multiuser sessions, annotations, and voice chat.
- Run safety and performance checks such as collisions, reach envelopes, and kinematics.
- Export session reports with findings, screenshots, and design notes.

## Why It Matters
- Faster design cycles through quick iterations without building physical prototypes.
- Lower cost by reducing material waste and prototyping expenses.
- Better collaboration as distributed teams can co-design in real time.
- Increased safety by identifying risks before physical testing.
- Improved innovation with more freedom to test, fail, and iterate virtually.

## Key Features
- CAD Import and Conversion: STEP/FBX/GLTF to optimized GLB with LODs.
- Immersive VR/AR Interaction: OpenXR support for Quest/PCVR and AR Foundation for HoloLens/ARKit/ARCore.
- Collaboration Tools: laser pointers, sticky notes, annotations, screenshots, follow mode.
- Safety and Simulation: collision detection, swept-volume analysis, ergonomic reach envelopes.
- Reporting and Versioning: export reports with diffs, thumbnails, and audit logs.
- Web Viewer: lightweight React + three.js preview for non-VR stakeholders.
